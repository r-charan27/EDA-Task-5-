🚢 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📑 Task Description
This project is a part of my Data Analyst Internship (Task 5).
The objective is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to extract insights using statistical and visual techniques.

Key Observations & Summary

🔎 Key Insights
Female passengers had a much higher survival rate than males.

Younger passengers were more likely to survive.

Higher-class passengers (Pclass 1) had better survival chances.

Fare showed a positive correlation with survival.
